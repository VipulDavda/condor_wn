Description
       condor_wn is a Linux-only tool that displays the snapshot information about jobs running 
       on the HTcondor cluster. The condor_wn tool is written in python using the client-side 
       APIs for HTCondor and the ClassAd language.

       Display table descritions:

       Summary Tables:
           Jobs per User table columns: User, Status, Requested CPUs, Total Number of Jobs, 
                                        Number of Cores and CPU Efficiency
           CPU Summary table columns:   Total Number of Worker Nodes, Total Number of CPUs, 
                                        Number of CPUs used, Number of CPUs free, Percentage of CPUs used.
           Jobs Summary table columns:  Total Number of jobs, Total completed, Total in held, Total in idle
                                        Total in held, Total in running, Total in removed queues
           Held jobs table columns: Condor Job ID, Job Owner, CPU requested, Job running time

           Idle jobs table columns: Condor Job ID, Job Owner, CPU requested, Job running time

           Long running jobs table columns: Condor Job ID, Job Owner, CPU requested, Job running time

           Jobs Exceeding CPU table columns: Worker node, Condor Job ID, Job Owner, CPU requested, CPU Efficiency, 
                                             Job running time

       Jobs per Worker node table column: Name, Status, Number of CPUS, %CPU used, %Memory used, Average Load, 
                                          Load Efficiency, Number of Jobs, Jobs Details
            Jobs Column: User: JobId, Number Requested CPUs, Running Time, Job Efficiency
           
       html option created an html file of the above tables

       If multiple worker nodes has to be onlined or offlined, a comma separated list can be used. 
       "ALL" input with --online/--offline option can be used to onlined/offlined all worker nodes.
 
Options
       --list <all:offline:online:multicore> 
            all:       displays all jobs running on worker nodes
            online:    displays only jobs running on online worker nodes
            offline:   displays only jobs running on offline worker nodes
            multicore: displays only jobs running the more than 1 CPUs on worker nodes

       --column n 
            sort the table by column number.

       --descending 
            sort the column by descending order.

       --summary 
            displays summary tables: Jobs per User, CPU Summary, Jobs Summary
            Additional tables: Held jobs, Idle jobs, Long running jobs and Exceeding CPU 
                               threshold jobs if criteria specified in the condor_wn.yaml 
                               file is met.

       --workernode <workernode> 
            display all jobs running on the worker node. Comma separated list can be used 
            to display multiple worker nodes.

       --user <username> 
            display all jobs owned by a user running on the worker nodes.  
            
       --online <workernode>
            online worker node. Comma separated list can be used to online worker nodes.

       --offline <workernode> 
            offline worker node. Comma separated list can be used to offline worker nodes.

       --html 
            create an html file of the display tables

       --help
            display simple help
